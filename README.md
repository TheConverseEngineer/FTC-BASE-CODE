# FTC-BASE-CODE
This repository serves as the base robot code for MT TECH FTC team. Code is open source. Inspiration comes from team 11115's pure
pursuit algorithm, team acmerobotics's paper of kinemetic vectors, and team 9929's FTC addons.

Features Include:
- Pure Pursuit Algorithm
- Mecanum Drive
- Velocity-based motion profiling
- Odometry wheels computation
- Automated Testing
- PID-Feedforward style controllers
- Native OpenCV vision code (coming soon)
- Advanced Gamepad library (coming soon)
- Fake Hardware(comming soon)
